    "## 1. Narrative of the process and attributes considered\n",
    "#### Process Description\n",
    "The routinary activity selected is the inbound dock operation at a mid-sized warehouse during a standard 8-hour shift (e.g., 8 AM to 4 PM). Trucks arrive to unload cargo, forming a single queue for available dock doors where workers unload the goods. Trucks are served on a first-come, first-served (FCFS) basis initially, but with priority considerations for high-urgency deliveries. If the queue is too long, drivers may balk and create bottle necks in the yard, leading to saftey issues and potentially reschedule deliveries. This is a discrete event simulation (DES) model, stochastic due to random arrivals and unload times, and dynamic as the queue evolves over time. This document a explanation of the Python code developed to simulate an inbound dock queuing system at a warehouse. The simulation models the arrival, queuing, and unloading of trucks at dock doors, comparing an original process with a modified process to address inefficiencies. The code uses discrete event simulation (DES) principles to replicate real-world logistics operations, aligning with queuing theory concepts from sources such as the Towards Data Science article on M/M/c queues and the R Journal on queueing models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code Functionality\n",
    "The Python code, implemented as the InboundDockQueue class, simulates a warehouse inbound dock operation over an 8-hour shift (480 minutes). It models two scenarios: the original process (2 dock doors, First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) queuing, higher balking probabilities) and the modified process (3 dock doors, priority queuing for high-priority trucks, lower balking probabilities). The simulation uses a stochastic DES approach, incorporating random arrivals and service times, consistent with the principles outlined in the first document on stochastic modeling and the Hurix.ai blog on DES.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components of the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization (__init__):\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- sim_time=480: Simulates an 8-hour shift (480 minutes).\n",
    "- replications=100: Runs 100 independent simulations to account for stochastic variability (Monte Carlo method).\n",
    "- original_mode=True/False: Toggles between original (2 docks, FCFS) and modified (3 docks, priority) processes.\n",
    "- lambda_arr=1/5.0: Poisson arrival rate of 12 trucks/hour (mean inter-arrival time of 5 minutes).\n",
    "- mu_high=1/10.0, mu_low=1/15.0: Exponential service rates for high-priority (10 minutes) and low-priority (15 minutes) trucks.\n",
    "- p_high=0.6: 60% of trucks are high-priority (e.g., perishable goods).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Initializes a Pandas DataFrame (self.results) to store simulation outputs.\n",
    "#### Trucks (Entities):\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes: Arrival time (Poisson-distributed inter-arrival with mean λ = 5 minutes, ~12 arrivals/hour), priority (high: 60% probability, e.g., urgent; low: 40%, e.g., standard), balk probability (50% if queue ≥4, 60% if ≥5 originally; reduced in modified).\n",
    "Estimated times: N/A.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dock Doors (Servers, c=2 originally):\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes: Unload rate (exponential; high priority: mean μ_high = 10 minutes; low: μ_low = 15 minutes), utilization (% time busy).\n",
    "Estimated times: Unload completion as above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Queue:\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes: Single queue (list for priority popping), current length.\n",
    "Estimated times: Wait time (from arrival to unload start).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps and Estimated Times \n",
    "\n",
    "Arrival: Truck enters dock area (Poisson, mean 5 min inter-arrival).\n",
    "Balk Check: If queue ≥4, 50% chance to leave; ≥5, 60% (0 min).\n",
    "Queue/Wait: Join queue if not balking (wait varies).\n",
    "Unload/Service: Assigned to first free door; high priority unloaded faster (exp 10 min) vs. low (15 min). In modified: high served first.\n",
    "Departure: Truck leaves post-unload (0 min).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Analysis of Bottlenecks in the Queue\n",
    "\n",
    "The original process exhibits several bottlenecks, identified through simulation results:\n",
    "\n",
    "Overloaded Docks: With only 2 docks, the traffic intensity (ρ = λ / (c * avg μ) ≈ 1.19, where λ = 12/hour, c = 2, avg μ = 1/11.67 based on 60% high-priority) exceeds 1, indicating an unstable queuing system prone to growing queues.\n",
    "Long Wait Times: The average wait time is 15.98 minutes, reflecting delays, especially for high-priority trucks, which increases balking.\n",
    "High Balking Rate: A 20.05% balk rate (~18.99 trucks/shift) indicates significant abandonment due to queue congestion (average length 2.75 trucks).\n",
    "Overutilization: Docks are busy ~91.23% of the time each (total 182.35%), straining resources and workers. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Suggested Changes\n",
    "To address these bottlenecks, the following improvements were implemented in the modified process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add a Third Dock: Increases capacity (c = 3), reducing traffic intensity to ρ ≈ 0.79, stabilizing the system.\n",
    "- Priority Queuing: High-priority trucks (60%) are served first, reducing their wait times and overall congestion.\n",
    "- Lower Balk Probabilities: Reduced to 30% (queue ≥4) and 40% (≥5), encouraging more trucks to join the queue.\n",
    "- Balanced Dock Assignment: Trucks are assigned to the least busy dock, optimizing resource use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Comparison of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Throughput (Trucks Served/Hour):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Original: 9.46 trucks/hour (~75.71/shift), indicating moderate efficiency but limited by capacity.\n",
    "- Modified: 11.61 trucks/hour (~92.86/shift), a 22.7% increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implication: The additional dock and priority queuing significantly boost throughput, handling more deliveries efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Balk Rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Original: 20.05% (~18.99 trucks balk), reflecting substantial loss due to long queues.\n",
    "- Modified: 3.84% (~3.71 trucks), an 80.9% reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implication: Lower balk probabilities and faster service reduce abandonment, improving customer satisfaction and reducing rescheduling costs, per Queue-it’s insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Average Wait Time:\n",
    "- Original: 15.98 minutes, indicating significant delays, especially during peak arrivals.\n",
    "- Modified: 5.40 minutes, a 66.2% reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implication: Priority queuing prioritizes high-priority trucks, reducing overall waits, aligning with Little’s Law (L = λW).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Average Queue Length:\n",
    "- Original: 2.75 trucks, showing frequent congestion.\n",
    "- Modified: 0.96 trucks, a 65.1% reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implication: Increased capacity and prioritization alleviate bottlenecks, reducing space constraints, per Hurix.ai’s DES principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Average Utilization (Per Dock):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Original: 91.23% per dock (total 182.35%), indicating overutilization (ρ ≈ 1.19).\n",
    "- Modified: 50.44% per dock (total 151.33%), a 44.7% reduction per dock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implication: The third dock balances load (ρ ≈ 0.79), reducing strain on workers, per queuing theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Total Arrivals:\n",
    "- Original: 97.45 trucks/shift.\n",
    "- Modified: 97.53 trucks/shift (negligible difference).\n",
    "Implication: Consistent arrivals ensure a fair comparison, with performance gains due to system improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python simulation successfully models the inbound dock queuing system, identifying key inefficiencies in the original process (overloaded docks, long waits, high balking) and demonstrating significant improvements in the modified process. The addition of a third dock, priority queuing, and lower balk probabilities result in a 22.7% increase in throughput, 80.9% reduction in balk rate, 66.2% decrease in wait time, and 65.1% shorter queues. These enhancements optimize warehouse operations, ensuring faster processing of urgent deliveries and better resource utilization. The simulation and analysis fulfill the assignment requirements, providing a robust, data-driven comparison supported by queuing theory and DES principles."
